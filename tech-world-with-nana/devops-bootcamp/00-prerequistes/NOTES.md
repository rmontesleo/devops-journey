## 4: How to Work Through the Bootcamp 

### Sample 01 Using prompts to solve issues, a sample with some bash script
```text
Here is my bash script, and its giving me the <PUT_THE_SPECIFIC_ERROR>
Analyze my script, and tell me what the issue is
<PASTE_THE_SCRIPT>

```

### Sample 02: with a docker file
```text
I'm getting the following error when running the docker-copose.yaml file
What is the issue I have to fixit
<PASTE_THE_DOCKER_FILE>
```

As you can, always provide all the permited context, other files, error messages, etc.
Give
- THe files (script, bash, yaml, terraform, docker, etc)
- the error you are getting
- the spected outcome or result of the files.

### Sample 03: Ask help for debuging
- give the context
- give the errors
- give files,
- ask for steps to debug, ask for detailed instructions about where and how to debug, ask for order to find things.


### Sample 04: Ask for detailed instructions and explanations.
```text
Explain kubernetes storage classes in simple words. I understand they are used to provision storage, but I dont' fully understand how it works!. Do I need setup  additional resources? how is the storage backend created exactly?  Give me details with specific examples.
```
